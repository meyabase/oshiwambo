# Osheng | Oshiwambo - English Digital Language Resource
## All contributors are welcome

This project aims to develop an Oshiwambo-English corpus for analysis and translational purposes. Our main focus is Oshindonga and Oshikwanyama as primary languages both mapped to English as a secondary language.

Our current data is sourced from:

1. Dictionaries
    - This involves extracting text from open-source Oshiwambo <-> English Translation dictionaries.

1. Translated Bibles
    - Data collection and cleaning

1. Online articles
    - This includes online blogs, online newspaper entries and other online resources by numerous organizations. In this category, some resources have bi-lingual textual data, while others only have one language, either Oshindonga or Oshikwanyama.
